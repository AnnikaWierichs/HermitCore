This post is a little bit off-topic.
I know that the [Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems](http://www.acs.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de)
 at [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de) is looking for PhD students for projects involving scalable multicore operating systems, multicore virtualization with quality of service guarantees and cloud computing.
 Recent computer science or computer engineering master graduates with background in operating systems, virtualization, dependability, checkpointing, migration techniques and/or distributed systems are sought for the open positions.
 Programming expertise with the Linux kernel and/or Linux-based hypervisors such as KVM is useful.

If you are interested, please contact the institute head for detail information.
