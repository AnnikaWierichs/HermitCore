HermitCore's current state was presented at the [Open Supercomputing Workshop](http://www.opensuco.community) that took place last Thursday in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
Even though it was the first time the workshop took place, the room was packed and the presentation sparked quite a few interesting discussions.
Thanks everyone for joining!
The [slides](/pdf/opensuco2017.pdf) are available online for your reading pleasure, feel free to imagine me babbling along while you read it.
