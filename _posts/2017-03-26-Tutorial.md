A new [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-54999-6_6), which describes the current state of HermitCore and early performance results, will be presented at the [30th International Conference on Architecture of Computing Systems (ARCS 2017)](http://arcs2017.itec.kit.edu).

To make the introduction to HermitCore easily understandable, small tutorials will be published at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOyT7BsncwKzQ8ftEpxQmvg/).
The first video shows the build process of the kernel and small tests with demo applications like the NAS Parellel Benchmakrs (NPB).
